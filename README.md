# Training_Project
Made this as my Summer Training cum Internship Project with [**ESCI**, Hyderabad](http://www.escihyd.org/)

### Services provided in this website project are:
* **Live Train Tracking**  
  In this we can track any trainâ€™s live location and also its current status, like __Delayed__ or __Not__.
  Users need to enter Train Number and Date of Start of Train, after pressing **GO** button they can see the current status of their train   and Current Station by location.

* **PNR Status Checking**  
  In this we can check PNR status of __live__ data. It provides all the details with respect to your journey ticket.
  Users only need to enter their PNR in query box and after pressing **GO** button they can see all their details on screen.

* **Train route Finder**  
  In this users can find scheduled route of their train and the days on which train runs.  
  It shows **arrival** and **departure** time for that train on every station in its route.  
  Users only need to enter their train number and hit the **GO** button. All the details of Scheduled Arrival & Departure wrt to Station     will   be on screen.**Train Name and Days on which it runs on** are also displayed.

* **Location Finder**  
  Users can track _themselves_ too. In this by just pressing single button, users can see their Live location on screen.
  It also displays geometric location of user in form of **Longitude** and **Latitude**.
  Note: _Best works with devices having GPS device like mobiles._

## In Next Update:

* I will be making use of the **LOGIN** and **RESISTER** services provided in the project.
  Now, users will be allowed to make account and add their **ALERTS** feature turn ON, so as to receive updates about their train in       every 5 mins.

Note:_for Login and Register, you will need to setup the [MONGO DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/). Configure them with this._

* Will be adding 2-3 services like **Seat Availability Checker** and **Trains between two Stations** etc.
